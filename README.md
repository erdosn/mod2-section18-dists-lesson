    * list the parameters that define specific distributions (Bernoulli and Binomial, Normal)
    * evaulate a normal distribution

* day 2
    * list the parameters that define specific distributions
    * apply distributions to solve problems

### Outline
* Discuss some distributions and their use cases
* Normal distribution measurements (skewness, kurtotis, jacque-bera)


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### What is/are a parameter(s)?
From parameters we get an idea of how it looks
Parameters define a distribution

### Normal Distribution
* Discrete or Continuous? 
    * you can apply both
* Parameters
    * standard deviation, $\sigma$
    * mean, $\mu$
* Use Cases
    * When we're asking questions about a sample or a population. 
    
* Examples
    * Given a normal distribution of discuss throws has a mean of 80 ft and a standard deviation of 5 ft, what is the probability of choosing a throw that is 70 ft? 
        * P(70) = 0
        * P(X=x) = 0, for all values of x
    * To calculate probabilities of a continuous distribution you need an interval.
    
    * This would change to 
        *  * Given a normal distribution of discuss throws has a mean of 80 ft and a standard deviation of 5 ft, what is the probability of choosing a throw that is between 69.9 ft and 70.1 ft? 
        
### (Bernoulli) Binomial Distribution
* Parameters
    * probability of success, p
    * number of trials, n
    * number of successes, k
* Use Cases
    * binary results (yes vs no, hit vs miss, 0 vs 1, win vs loss)
    * If you have a fairly weighted coin and you flip it 5 times, what is the probability of flipping a head 4 times? 
        * does this use a PDF or CDF? PDF, because I'm asking for one specific value on my Probability Distribution
        * 5C4(0.5^5)
    * If you have a fairly weighted coin and you flip it 5 times, what is the probability of flipping at least 4?
        * P(4 heads|X=0.50) + P(5 heads|X=0.50) = 5C4(0.5^5) + 5C5(0.5^5)
        
    * The probability of Andrew spending more 20 dollars at HEB is 0.10.  If Andrew goes to HEB 4 times a month, what is the probability he spends more than 20 dollars at least twice. 
        * CDF 
        * P(k>=2|p(k)==0.10, n=4) = P(2) + P(3) + P(4) 
            * P(2) = 4C2(0.1^2 \* 0.9^2)
            * P(3) = 4C3(0.1^3 \* 0.9)
            * P(4) = 4C4(0.1^4)
        
    * Continuous or Discrete?
        * Discrete, because it's defined by n trials and k successes, both are integers and because it's win vs loss which is binary. 
 

    
    
### Poisson Distribution

### Uniform Distribution

### Let's get into Normal Distributions
how do we measure normality?

* Mean, Median, Mode being equal...hmmm...this is great for symmetry, but misses the bell curve
* 65, 95, 99.7 test 1std, 2std, 3stds from the mean, checks the bell curve
* Skewness....
    * How well the data is distributed about the mean
    * How 'centered' the data is
    * which direction the data is stretched
* Kurtosis....
    * How fat/thin the tails are


```python
# let's make a random list of integers between 0 and 20
x = np.random.normal(100, 10, 10000)
plt.hist(x)
plt.show()
```


![png](lesson-plan_files/lesson-plan_6_0.png)



```python
# let's calculate skewness and kurtosis
# desired skewness = 0
# skewness measures symmetry

print(f"Skewness = {stats.skew(x)}")


# desired kurtosis score = 3
print(f"Kurtosis (normal) = {stats.kurtosis(x, fisher=False)}")
print(f"Kurtosis (Fisher) = {stats.kurtosis(x)}")
```

    Skewness = -0.00037496692678199914
    Kurtosis (normal) = 2.9211109969902465
    Kurtosis (Fisher) = -0.07888900300975354



```python
# test for normality
# shapiro test
# H0 : x is normal (fail to reject this) -> pvalue > 0.05
# HA: x is not normal

stats.shapiro(x)
```




    (0.999799907207489, 0.5040658712387085)



### get percentages for standard deviation ranges


```python
# what does this return?
for i in range(1, 5):
    num_points = np.where(abs(x) < (x.mean() + i*x.std()))[0].shape[0]
    print("points within {} standard deviations = {}".format(i, num_points/100))
    # tuple 
```

    points within 1 standard deviations = 83.92
    points within 2 standard deviations = 97.85
    points within 3 standard deviations = 99.88
    points within 4 standard deviations = 99.99


### Standard Normal Distribution
* This is a normal distribution
* mu = 0, std = 1
* How can we transform any distribution to the standard normal?


```python
print(x.mean(), x.std())
plt.hist(x)
plt.show()
```

```python
np.std(x - x.mean())
```




    9.98035682742741




```python
def zscore(x):
    return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()
```


```python
x_standard = zscore(x)
```


```python
plt.hist(x_standard)
plt.show()
```


![png](lesson-plan_files/lesson-plan_16_0.png)



```python
print(x[0], x_standard[0])
print(x[1], x_standard[1])

# the standard deviations a point is from the mean
```

### What is the benefit of standardizing normal distributions? 
* You can more easily see the points within standard deviations
* Makes it easier to compare datasets

### What did we learn? 
* Learned the explicit difference and visual difference between PDF and CDF.
* What are zcore standardization
* Continuous vs discrete
* Skewness measures the symmetry around the mean
* Kurtosis measures the peakiness
    * small kurtosis - most points are really close to the mean
    * large kurtosis - lots of outliers
* What does a zscore measure? 
    * 'distance' from the mean in terms of standard deviation

```python
import numpy as np
from math import factorial

def poisson(lam, x):
    p = (lam**x * np.exp(-lam)) / factorial(x)
    return p
```


```python
events = list(range(0, 50))

# rate is the number of occurences in investigated time interval
# 
lam = 10 

probabilities = [poisson(lam=lam, x=i) for i in events]
```


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(events, probabilities, linewidth=2)
plt.title(f"Poisson Distribution for {lam}")
plt.xticks(events, events, rotation=90)
plt.show()
```

Question 2:

There are 10 people that tweet about the google pixel 4, every 20 minutes. What is the probability that 5 people will tweet about it in 5 minutes?


```python
lam = 10/4 # since 10 people tweet every 20 minutes and 20/4 = 5 minutes

poisson(lam=lam, x=5)
```

### What is something you learned about? 
* In a poisson distribution, time (or your interval) is very important
* Poisson distributions are discrete because the number of the events is whole
* Poisson/Exponential is used for observing the rate of change on an interval
    * Poisson observations are discrete
    * Exponential are continuous
* How do you calculate the probability of a uniform continuous distribution?
    * Calculate the area of the rectangle bounded by your desired events
    * It's a rectangle, because in a uniform distribution, every event has the same probability of occurring


```python

```
